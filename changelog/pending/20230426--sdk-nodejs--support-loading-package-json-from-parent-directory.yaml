  description: Support loading package.json from parent directory. If `package.json` is not found in the Pulumi main directory, Pulumi recursively searches up the directory tree until it is found. If `package.json` provides a `main` field, per the [NPM spec](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#main), that field is relative to the directory containing package.json.
