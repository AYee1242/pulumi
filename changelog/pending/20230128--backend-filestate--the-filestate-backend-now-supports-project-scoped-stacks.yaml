    Add support for project-scoped stacks.
    Newly initialized storage will automatically use this mode.
    Set PULUMI_SELF_MANAGED_STATE_LEGACY_LAYOUT=1 to opt-out of this.
    This mode needs write access to the root of the .pulumi directory;
    if you're using a cloud storage, be sure to update your ACLs.
